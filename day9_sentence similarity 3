#You are given two strings sentence1 and sentence2, each representing a sentence composed of words. 
#A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.
# Each word consists of only uppercase and lowercase English characters.
#Two sentences s1 and s2 are considered similar if it is possible to insert an arbitrary sentence (possibly empty) inside one of these sentences such that the two sentences become equal.
#Note that the inserted sentence must be separated from existing words by spaces.

  class Solution:
    def areSentencesSimilar(self, sentence1: str, sentence2: str) -> bool:
        s1 = sentence1.split(" ")
        s2 = sentence2.split(" ")

        #keeping s1 as the smaller one
        if len(s2) < len(s1):
            s1, s2 = s2, s1

        #s1 should be the prefix or suffix or both
        l1 = 0
        while l1 < len(s1) and s1[l1] == s2[l1]:
            l1 += 1

        r1, r2 = len(s1) - 1, len(s2) - 1
        while r1 >= l1 and r2 >= 0 and s1[r1] == s2[r2]:
            r1, r2 = r1 -1, r2 - 1

        return l1 > r1
